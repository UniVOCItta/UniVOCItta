[Homepage](https://univocitta.github.io/UniVOCItta/#) of the project. 

# About 
UniVOCIttà is a digital humanities research project developed by the LBC-CeSLiC unit at the Department of Modern Languages, Literature and Cultures ([LILEC](https://lingue.unibo.it/it)) of the University of Bologna. Launched in July 2022, it builds on the outcomes of the previous [UNICittà](https://site.unibo.it/unicitta/it) project, which focused on compiling a corpus of historical and present testimonies on the renowned University of Bologna.

# Objectives 
The project aims to collect the “voices” of outstanding travellers who passed through the city of Bologna and its surrounding area, promoting an innovative interpretation of its rich tangible and intangible heritage.
The project's mobile and web application was designed as a prototype to test an innovative methodological approach.

# Funding
The project was generously funded by the European Union - NextGeneration EU under the “ALMA IDEA 2022 call - Linea A finanziata a valere sulle risorse del D.M. 737/2021” – UniVOCIttà: Voci digitali sull’unicità del patrimonio bolognese – CUP J45F21002000001.
