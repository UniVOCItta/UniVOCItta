Shortly afterwards, in Madrid, he became editor of El látigo, a satirical newspaper. A volunteer soldier during the African War of 1959-60, he was later a member of Parliament in 1864 and a member of the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language (1877). In the autumn of 1860 he made a trip to Italy, which provided him with material for a highly successful book De Madrid a Nápoles (1861), lively and rich in colour, one of the most widely read travel books written in Spanish.[<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Antonio_de_Alarc%C3%B3n\">Wikipedia</a>].",

He wrote novels centred on social reality, naturalistic and realistic (Fortunata y Jacinta, 1886-87), dealing with moral, sociological and psychological problems, and the theme of the contrast between tradition and modernity. In Journey to Italy (1900), he gives evidence of his vision of the country, visiting Rome, Verona, Venice, Padua, Bologna, Florence, Naples and Pompeii. These places are filtered through the sensibility of the 'wandering Spaniard', as he liked to define himself.[<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_P%C3%A9rez_Gald%C3%B3s\">Wikipedia</a>].",

His passion for the theatre led him to write the essay The Origins of Spanish Theatre and to translate Shakespeare and Molière. He made numerous trips to Europe, taking advantage of the protection of the minister Manuel Godoy. With the latter's defenestration, he became part of Joseph Bonaparte's regime, taking on the role of royal librarian.

After many vicissitudes, he managed to escape through Greece and, from Messina, through Italy, to return to Spain. He reports extensively on all this in his Journey through Turkey (16th century).

Finally redeemed, he returned to his homeland where he lived amidst failed business deals, excommunications and various arrests. Cervantes' literary activity was multifaceted.
